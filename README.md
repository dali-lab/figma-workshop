# Figma Workshop
## For Aspiring Unicorns

Welcome! Today, we'll be learning about how to use Figma, a nice Google-Docs-esque interface design tool that lets you collaborate with others while doing mockup designs. It has a few other neat features, especially for your devs, and we'll explore some of them as we go through the workshop!

Today, we'll be building mockups for a basic landing page, and then we'll take those mockups and build it for real! So,

- üíª Devs are going to learn how to build some mockups
- üé® Designers are going to explore some HTML and CSS

And everyone will be taking their first steps toward glorious unicorndom!

Let's get started!

## Design: Mockups with Figma

Make your way over to [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Create an account if you don't have one yet!

Hit up that + button in the upper left hand corner (to make a new file), or press the "+ New File" tile in the middle of the screen.

I know, you're probably thinking: Wow, what a horribly boring mockup--it looks all blank. Don't worry, soon it'll look industry-standard level baller, and it'll have been all thanks to you.

### Adding a Frame
To start, we'll need a frame. Click on the frame tool (or press the hotkey F) and then some options will appear on the right. Select "Desktop HD", and then a frame will appear in the view. You can drag it wherever you'd like.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: for designers that know Sketch, these are the same as what Sketch calls "artboards".

### Working with Shapes
Click the shapes tool in the top right corner. In the dropdown menu, select the square. Make on in the frame!
We can:
- Resize: Just like you'd expect, drag the corner boxes
- Rotate: move mouse just off corners, and drag
- Fix aspect: Hold shift when resizing
- Resize from center: Hold alt/option while resizing
- Copy: Option-drag to copy
- Align: tools for this are in the top right
  - Soon we'll see alignment's analogue when we do flexbox in CSS! üÜí

### Colors
Disclaimer: this site we're about to show you is super cool. Two of the authors just found out about it from the third author while writing this workshop.

Make your way over to [Coolors.com](https://coolors.co/). Click "start the generator". It's lit fam.

Mash the spacebar until you find a color you like. Then click the lock button and mash space more, and you'll get an amazing, custom-tailored color scheme for your landing page. When you're happy, copy and paste the hex codes into Figma.

### Gradients
[Add some funny shit about the history of gradients]

Color transitions, on the other hand, are super in, if not overused.

Select an element. Click the square of the fill, which will pop up a color selector. In the dropdown at the top, change "solid" to "linear". Then, try to pick two colors that work together (hint: use [coolors](https://coolors.co/)!). Drag the nodes around the shape to adjust the direction of the gradient.

Protip: vertical, horizontal, and corner-to-corner transitions bring back inklings of the early 2000s, a time when website design was in its adolescent stage, rife with acne and body odor. If you want the site to look refined, a nice slant just off the horizontal can have a nice effect.

### Image Manipulation
If you want an image in the background instead of colors, you can get some nice stock photos thanks to the generous open-source copyright policies of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). Go ahead and grab an image from there.

If you're stumped for ideas, try "horizon", "skyline", or "delirious sausage".
